# Terminal Basics

When I started programming, I discovered that the command line interface must become my new friend. The problem was that I didn't know any commands to speak with him. After doing a little research on the web I realized that there a huge number of articles and explanations, which most of them are good and very informative, but it can be difficult for a novice to filter all and to connect with that information.  
  
It was the reason to create this guide. Here I try to collect the most used commands and compose them together in the most concentrated, but at the same time, very clear and understandable for a beginner form.  
  
_Works on zsh / bash shells._
